###### LEARN JAVA: ARRAYS

### String[] args

When we write main() methods for our programs, we use the parameter String[] args. Now that we know about array syntax, we can start to parse what this means.

A String[] is an array made up of Strings. Examples of String arrays:
```
String[] humans = {"Talesha", "Gareth", "Cassie", "Alex"};
String[] robots = {"R2D2", "Marvin", "Bender", "Ava"};
```
The args parameter is another example of a String array. In this case, the array args contains the arguments that we pass in from the terminal when we run the class file. (So far, args has been empty.)

So how can you pass arguments to main()? Letâ€™s say we have this class HelloYou:
```
public class HelloYou {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello " + args[0]);  
  }
}
```
When we run the file HelloYou in the terminal with an argument of "Laura":

>java HelloYou Laura

We get the output:

Hello Laura
The String[] args would be interpreted as an array with one element, "Laura".

When we use args[0] in the main method, we can access that element like we did in HelloYou.

#### Instructions

1. We want to give the user an option to make a Newsfeed object for robots or for humans. We will take either "Robot" or "Human" as an argument to the main() method when the Newsfeed.java file is run.

    If the args array holds "Human", we will initialize the feed with human topics.

    If the args array holds "Robot", we will initialize the feed with robot topics.
    
    Replace the blank in the conditional statement to reflect this expected control flow.

2. In the terminal, run the Newsfeed.java file with the argument "Robot".

    Now, run the Newsfeed.java file with the argument "Human".
