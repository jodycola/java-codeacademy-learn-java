#### Math Magic

In this project, you will become a mathemagician and write a small program that performs a mathematical magic trick! It will involve performing arithmetic operations on an integer that you choose.

The instructions provided are general guidelines. Upon completion of the project, feel free to explore the code on your own.

#### Tasks

1. Create an int variable called myNumber.

    Set it equal to any integer other than 0.

2. We will refer to myNumber as the original number from now on - it might be helpful to document this.

    Write a comment in the program that documents this.

3. Create an int variable called stepOne.

    Set it equal to the original number (myNumber) multiplied by itself.

4. Create an int variable called stepTwo.

    Set it equal to the previous result (stepOne) plus the original number (myNumber).

5. Create an int variable called stepThree.

    Set it equal to the previous result (stepTwo) divided by the original number.

6. Create an int variable called stepFour.

    Set it equal to the previous result (stepThree) plus 17.

7. Create an int variable called stepFive.

    Set it equal to the previous result (stepFour) minus the original number.

8. Create an int variable called stepSix.

    Set it equal to the previous result (stepFive) divided by 6.

9. Print out the value of the last step.

    Then, save and run your code!

    What number is printed to the console?

10. Now, go back to your code and change myNumber to any other integer. Run your program again.

    Is the output the same?

    It’s math magic!

    Note: Due to the range of the int primitive data type, only set myNumber to integer values between -46,341 and 46,340 (both inclusive). Values outside of this range for myNumber will cause the value of stepOne to exceed the maximum possible value of int when we multiply myNumber by itself, which can cause the program to produce unexpected results!

11. Great job completing this project! Want to keep challenging yourself?

    Recreate this project using only two variables: myNumber and magicNumber. Use your understanding of compound assignment operators to recreate the above program by only manipulating magicNumber.
