###### LEARN JAVA: ARRAYLISTS

### Accessing an Index

With arrays, we can use bracket notation to access a value at a particular index:
```
double[] ratings = {3.2, 2.5, 1.7};

System.out.println(ratings[1]);
```
This code prints 2.5, the value at index 1 of the array.

For ArrayLists, bracket notation wonâ€™t work. Instead, we use the method get() to access an index:
```
ArrayList<String> shoppingCart = new ArrayList<String>();
 
shoppingCart.add("Trench Coat");
shoppingCart.add("Tweed Houndstooth Hat");
shoppingCart.add("Magnifying Glass");
 
System.out.println(shoppingCart.get(2));
```
This code prints "Magnifying Glass", which is the value at index 2 of the ArrayList.

#### Instructions

1. Use get() to access the third to-do element of sherlocksToDos and print the result.

2. Use get() to access the second to-do element of poirotsToDos and print the result.
