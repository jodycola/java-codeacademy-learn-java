###### STRING METHODS

### toUpperCase() / toLowerCase()

There will be times when we have a word in a case other than what we need it in. Luckily, Java has a couple String methods to help us out:
```
toUpperCase(): returns the string value converted to uppercase
toLowerCase(): returns the string value converted to lowercase
```
For example:
```
String input = "Cricket!";
 
String upper = input.toUpperCase();
// stores "CRICKET!"
 
String lower = input.toLowerCase();
// stores "cricket!"
```
A good use of this functionality is to ensure consistency of the data you store in a database. Making sure all of the data you get from a user is lowercase before you store it in your database will make your database easier to search through later.

#### Instructions

1. In Hashtag.java, use toLowerCase() to print out the lower case version of hashtag.
