###### LEARN JAVA: VARIABLES

### Review

Creating and filling variables is a powerful concept that allows us to keep track of all kinds of data in our program.

In this lesson, we learned how to create and print several different data types in Java, which youâ€™ll use as you create bigger and more complex programs.

We covered:

int, which stores whole numbers.
double, which stores bigger whole numbers and decimal numbers.
boolean, which stores true and false.
char, which stores single characters using single quotes.
String, which stores multiple characters using double quotes.
Static typing, which is one of the safety features of Java.
Variable naming conventions.
Practice declaring variables and assigning values to make sure you have a solid foundation for learning more complicated and exciting Java concepts!

#### Instructions

1. The file MyProfile.java contains a class that represents your hiring profile as presented to potential employers.

2. Create a variable called age that holds your age as a whole number.

3. Create a variable called desiredSalary that holds your desired salary per year to a precision of two decimal points.
